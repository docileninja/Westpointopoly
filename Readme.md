# WestPointopoly

## Description

This game is a simplified version of the classic game of monopoly. The classic monopoly paradigms would be tailored to West Point traditions. For instance, instead of jail one would walk hours instead. Local restaurants such as Schades' and American Burrito could replace the railroads. Arvin and Hayes would replace the utilities.

## Equipment

A standard West Point monopoly game will require (simulated) board with spaces around the edges, 4 or more player tokens to choose from, a pair of dice, and $$$$.

## Rules

Monopoly is played by 2 - 4 players. Play advances when players roll the dice to get around the board. When a player lands on an unowned property, they have to opportunity to buy it (prices will vary but will increase around the board). If the property is already owned they must pay rent to the owner for half of the purchase price.

Whenever the player passes "Payday" (Go) they are payed according to their class year (number of times they have been around the board - $200, $250, $350, $450). Play continues until one player remains after all others have run out of money.

If a player rolls doubles they must walk hours for three turns or pay $50 to get put on a work detail to get out early.

When a player is out of the game, their properties remain in play but all funds payed go to the DCA/USMA Treasurer.
